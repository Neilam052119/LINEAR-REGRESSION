# LINEAR-REGRESSION

Basics of Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, Sklearn, Statsmodel needed<br>
STEPS:<br>
Import data, handle Null value, handle duplicate values.<br>
Figure out the Data Types of Each feature as well as the Target Variable.<br>
Find the Categorical Column and Numerical Column as well this step will help you perform better EDA.<br>
Doing EDA: EDA can be done with simple one two-line code for each and individual feature or one can use code or for loops to do same work or one can use some library for basic EDA eg: Dataprep lib.<br>
Then handle Data: Treat Outliers or do encoding using any  suitable encoding method of Categorical Feature as needed before moving further.<br>
Split Train and Test data.<br>
Fit the train model in Linear Regression, finding train and test scores. One can decide on which model is underfit, overfit or normal and accordingly take action like using the OLS model or L1-L2 Regularization.<br>
