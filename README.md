# LINEAR-REGRESSION

Basics of Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn,Numpy,Sklearn,Statsmodel needed
STEPS:
Import data , handle Null value , handle duplicate values.
Figure out Data Types of Each feature as well as Target Variable.
Find Categorical Column and Numerical Column as well this step will help you preform better ED
Doing EDA : EDA can be done with simple one two line code for each and individual feature or one can use code or for loops to do same work or one can use some libarary for basic EDA eg: Dataprep lib
Then handle Data eg:treat Outliers and do encoding as needed before moving further.
Split Train and Test data 
Fit the train model in Linear Regression , finding train and test score .One can decide model in underfit or overfit or normal accordingly take action like use OLS model or L1-L2 Regularization.
